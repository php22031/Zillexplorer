Zillexplorer is a block explorer for the Zilliqa platform.

INSTALLATION: 

1) Create a MySQL database, and install the table structure in the "_INSTALL" directory.

2) Setup config.php.

3) Setup a cron job for every 2 minutes for cron-jobs.php.

THIS IS A VERY EARLY PRE-RELEASE, and the Zilliqa developers are still very busy creating the network and corrisponding APIs that will allow full feature sets (like transaction histories which are on the way here: https://github.com/Zilliqa/Zilliqa/issues/538 ). 

Please feel free to report any bugs or suggestions here:
